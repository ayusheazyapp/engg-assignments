# Technical Task: Build a Data-Driven Android Application

## Objective
The purpose of this technical task is to assess your ability to develop a data-heavy Android application using Java and Kotlin. The application will interact with backend APIs to retrieve and display data in lists, ensuring efficient handling of large datasets and presenting them in a visually appealing manner.

## Requirements

### Backend API Integration
- Choose a public RESTful API (e.g., GitHub API, OpenWeatherMap API, or any other suitable API) that provides a substantial amount of data.
- Implement functionality to fetch data from the chosen API using Retrofit (or any other HTTP client library of your choice).
- Handle API responses appropriately, including error handling and parsing JSON data.

### Data Presentation
- Display the retrieved data in a RecyclerView or ListView, showcasing a list of items (e.g., repositories, weather forecast, etc.).
- Design the UI/UX to present the data in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner, ensuring smooth scrolling and responsiveness.
- Implement features such as pagination or infinite scrolling to efficiently handle large datasets.

### Data Details Screen
- Upon selecting an item from the list, navigate to a detailed screen displaying additional information about the selected item.
- Design the details screen layout to present relevant details in a clear and organized manner.
- Implement navigation back to the list screen.

### Additional Features (Optional)
- Implement search functionality to allow users to search and filter the data based on specific criteria.
- Add caching mechanism (e.g., using Room Persistence Library) to store and retrieve data locally, enhancing app performance and offline capabilities.
- Incorporate any other features or enhancements you deem relevant to showcase your skills and creativity.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Technical Proficiency:**
   - Effective use of Java and Kotlin programming languages.
   - Efficient integration with backend APIs and handling of network requests.
   - Proper implementation of data presentation components (RecyclerView/Listview) and UI/UX design principles.

2. **Data Handling and Performance:**
   - Ability to manage and present large datasets smoothly and efficiently.
   - Implementation of features such as pagination, caching, or search functionality to enhance user experience.

3. **Code Quality and Organization:**
   - Clean, readable, and well-structured code following best practices and design patterns.
   - Proper use of naming conventions, comments, and documentation where necessary.

4. **Creativity and Attention to Detail:**
   - Creative design and presentation of data to deliver a visually appealing and intuitive user experience.
   - Attention to detail in implementing additional features or enhancements to demonstrate your skills and problem-solving abilities.

## Submission Guidelines
- Create a new repository on GitHub or GitLab to host your project.
- Complete the technical task following the requirements outlined above.
- Provide clear instructions on how to build and run the application.
- Share the repository link with us for evaluation.

**Note:** Feel free to use any third-party libraries or frameworks you find appropriate to accomplish the task. Focus on demonstrating your ability to develop a robust and efficient Android application that effectively handles data-heavy operations and delivers an exceptional user experience. Good luck!
