# Fullstack Web Developer Assignment: RentOk

## Assignment Description

Your task is to build a Next.js project that implements subdomain (multi-tenant) routing. The project should have a single page with customizable elements based on the subdomain. The goal is to create a dynamic and customizable web application where the appearance and content of the page change based on the subdomain accessed.

While this is a tech assignment, I would encourage you to not look at it just as an assignment to finish but rather look at it from a product perspective. Imagine you are building a product that allows subdomains and can be evolved later (imagine Shopify). Once completed, we will also be discussing how this can evolve into a fully functional product that allows users to have their own subdomains.

## Requirements

1. Create a Next.js project with the necessary configurations.
2. Implement subdomain routing to differentiate between different tenants (subdomains). Make sure the subdomains are not hard coded.
3. Design a single page component that will be customized based on the subdomain.
4. The customizable elements of the page component should include:
   - Color Scheme: Each subdomain should have its own distinct color scheme.
   - Content: Different subdomains may display different textual content on the page.
   - Images: Customizable images associated with each subdomain.
   - Styles: Basic styling such as fonts, margins, etc.

## Instructions

1. Set up a Next.js project.
2. Implement the subdomain routing logic using Next.js routing features.
3. Create a single page component that will be the landing page for all subdomains.
4. Implement a mechanism to read the subdomain and apply appropriate customizations to the page.
5. Use CSS or styling libraries to manage the color scheme and styles as per the subdomain.
6. Make sure the code is well-organized, maintainable, and follows best practices.
7. Document the code where necessary to explain your design decisions.
8. Once completed, push the code to your GitHub and make it a public repo.

**Note**: If time allows, you can design a user interface that includes sections for customizable content for different subdomains as well.

## Evaluation Criteria

You will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Functionality**: Does the project meet the specified requirements? Does the subdomain routing work correctly? Also, think about how this will evolve when new subdomains are to be created dynamically.

2. **Customization**: Are the customizable elements (color scheme, content, images, styles) distinct for each subdomain?

3. **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, organized, and easy to understand?

4. **Scalability**: How does the codebase look if we want to add a bunch of new features to it? Are there any restrictions?

5. **Documentation**: Is there sufficient documentation to explain the project's structure, setup process, and any design decisions?

6. **Research and Product Understanding**: You can find a lot of information about this project on the web. Feel free to research and learn about the best implementation. Once implemented in the code, make sure you know how everything works. We do not like it if you simply copy-paste the code and know nothing about it.

## Submission

Submit your completed assessment by pushing your code to GitHub by making it a public repo and share the repo link with us over email ([nj@eazyapp.tech](mailto:nj@eazyapp.tech)).

Standard expectation for this assignment would be 6-8 hours. Let me know when you can complete this assignment.

Good luck! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
